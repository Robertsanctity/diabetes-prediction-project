Title: Developing a Predictive Model for Diabetes Diagnosis
Introduction:
Diabetes mellitus, a chronic metabolic disorder, is a growing global health concern, particularly in developing countries. Early detection and intervention are crucial to managing and preventing severe complications. This project focuses on building a predictive model for diabetes using machine learning techniques, leveraging clinical and lifestyle data to identify individuals at risk.
Objective:
To develop a robust machine learning-based predictive system that accurately identifies individuals at high risk of diabetes, facilitating early diagnosis and preventive care.
